# Password Generator

This project is a Password Generator that allows the user to generate secure passwords by selecting from customizable criteria. The user is presented with a series of prompts to choose from that will generate a secure password. The criteria includes the options of password length, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Based on the user's choices, the generator creates a random password that matches the selected criteria.

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a tool to generate strong and unique passwords, which are essential for maintaining online security.
